## Overview
Having existed since 1984, Tetris has become widely known across the globe as a classic computer game where pieces fall from the sky and you have to rearrange them as they fall. The shapes are
simplistic, given the nature of 4-bit and 8-bit technology in the 80's. Alexey Pajitnov created a game fun for anyone and simple enough for everyone to understand. Here we will be trying to recreate the game and have fun styling the game as we go!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- Play the game of Tetris on web or mobile
- Use either their keys or touch-pad
